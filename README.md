# PODs Template Webpage

## Creating your own PODs webpage

### Source Code Download

1. Click the green button above that says "Code" and then tap "Download ZIP".
2. This will download the code for the webpage to your local machine.
3. Unzip the ZIP you just downloaded and you'll be left with the folder with the source code.

### About the Source Code

The source code has a few files and folders worth getting familiar with:

- `index.html` houses the HTML for the webpage (everything inside `<section id="pods"></section>`)
- `style.css` houses the styling required for the webpage to make the page properly formatted
- `base.css` is another styles file to make the webpage look similar to https://merakifoundation.in/pods specifically
	- This file won't be required while integration if your website already has a base set of styles for things like paragraphs, links, headings, etc.
- `/img` is a folder containing images being used on the template webpage
	- Feel free to pick and choose what you want to use from this folder while integrating

### Code Integation (with your website!)

1. Copy over everything in `<section id="pods"></section>` from `index.html` to your website
2. Update and mould the HTML (and images!) you copied over according to your needs
3. Copy over styles from `style.css` into your website's CSS code
4. Tweak and fine-tune the webpage to make it look the best for your needs
5. That's it! You've successfully integrated the PODs template on your website.
